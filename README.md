## Abstract
A complex AI system must be worked offline because the training and execution phases are processed separately. This process often requires different computer resources due to the high model requirements. A limitation of this approach is the convoluted training process that needs to be repeated to obtain models with new data continuously incorporated into the knowledge base. Although the environment may be not static, it is crucial to dynamically train models by integrating new information during execution.
In this article, artificial neural networks (ANN) are developed to predict risk levels in traffic accidents with relatively simpler configurations than a Deep Learning (DL) model, which is more computationally intensive. The objective is to demonstrate that efficient, fast, and comparable results can be obtained using simple architectures such as that offered by the Radial Basis Function neural network (RBFNN).
This work led to the generation of the driving dataset, which was subsequently validated for testing ANN models. The driving dataset simulated the dynamic approach by adding new data to the training on the fly, given the constant changes in the driver's data, vehicle information, environmental conditions, and traffic accidents.
The study compares the processing time and performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RF), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), using evaluation metrics of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity-recall to recommend an appropriate, simple, and fast ANN architecture that can be implemented in a secure alert traffic system that uses encrypted data.
